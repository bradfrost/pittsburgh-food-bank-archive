			&lt;h3&gt;KD Turkey Fund&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;More than 30 years ago, KDKA-TV personality Al Julius was given a ten-dollar bill by a listener with instructions to &quot;help a local family have a Thanksgiving turkey,&quot; and the KD Turkey Drive was born. Over twelve million dollars later, tens of thousands of families in need have been able to gather with their families and celebrate with thanks of their own. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h3&gt;Scouting for Food&lt;/h3&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;Scouting for Food is the Boy Scouts of America-Laurel Highlands Council's annual food drive, the largest of the spring season. Scouts collect food in their neighborhoods and many conscientious corporations participate by collecting food or hosting a Virtual Food Drive. This region-wide drive helps the Food Bank and dozens of local food pantries.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;h3&gt;Stamp Out Hunger&lt;/h3&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;The National Association of Letter Carriers' &quot;Stamp Out Hunger&quot; Campaign is the largest one-day food drive in the nation, collecting more than 70 million pounds of food each year. Held in mid-May, all you have to do is put a sturdy bag of non-perishable grocery items out by your mail box before your regular mail delivery time, and your friendly letter carrier will pick it up. All donations remain in the area they were collected - a great opportunity to help struggling families right in your neighborhood! &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;a id=&quot;walk&quot; name=&quot;walk&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;	
					&lt;h3&gt;Walk for A Healthy Community&lt;/h3&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;Held in May, the Highmark Walk for A Healthy Community benefits dozens of local charities which sign up walkers and sponsors. Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield underwrites the cost of the Walk, so all proceeds go directly to the charities. Combining healthy exercise with supporting the Food Bank - what a concept! &lt;/p&gt;
